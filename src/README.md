# Insurance Company App - Proof of Concept (POC)

## 1. Micro-Frontend Architecture Overview

This is a POC of an insurance company app, developed using micro-frontend architecture with React. The application consists of three apps:

### 1.1 Container App

This is the shell/container application responsible for handling the user sign-in/sign-up process and loading the micro-frontends.

### 1.2 Users App

This is a micro-frontend app responsible for displaying the user profile details and checking if the user is eligible for insurance offers.

### 1.3 Insurance App

This is a micro-frontend app responsible for displaying the user's insurance details (existing) and allowing the user to pay the premium.

## 2. Features & Functionality

### 2.1 Container App

- Seed the user and insurance data to local storage on startup.
- Show the login page that takes an email address as input.
- **Sign-in button** functionality:
  - Check the email format.
  - Sanitize the input to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks (OWASP top 10).
  - Check if the user with the given email address exists:
    - If yes, redirect to the landing page and load the user details micro-frontend.
    - If not, stay on the login screen and show an error message.
- Show the menu sidebar with a few buttons/links.
- Display the logged-in user's name at the top.
- **View Profile Details** button will load the user micro-frontend app and display user details.
- **View Insurance Details** button will load the insurance micro-frontend app and show insurance details.
- **Send Message** button will dispatch an event, which will be listened to by both the micro-frontend apps (if already loaded), and lead to displaying a message.
- **Logout Button** will log out the user and redirect to the login screen.

### 2.2 Users App

- Use a background worker to calculate and find the best offers as per the user’s eligibility (e.g., check age, gender, income, and find suitable offers).
- Show the user profile details.
- Listen to the message/event sent from the Container app and display the message accordingly.

### 2.3 Insurance App

- Uses a background worker to call an API every few seconds and display a fun fact on the screen (simulation of an actual API call).
- Show the user’s insurance details.
- On click of the **Pay the Premium** button, show the payment options and enable premium payment.
- On click of the **Cancel** button, hide the payment options.
- Listen to the message/event sent from the Container app and display the message accordingly.

## 5. How to Run the App

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application:

- Clone or download & unzip the code.
- Open the code in any IDE like Visual Studio Code.
- You’ll see three folders named `container`, `users`, and `insurance`.
- Open the integrated terminal.
- **Execute the following commands**:

### First run the Users App

```bash
cd users
npm install
npm start
```

##### Users’ app will now be running at http://localhost:8081. Same can be verified in browser.

### Then run the Insurance App

```bash
cd insurance
npm install
npm start
```

##### Insurance app will now be running at http://localhost:8080. Same can be verified in browser.

### And then run the Container App

```bash
cd container
npm install
npm start
```

##### Container app will now be running at http://localhost:8082. Same can be verified in browser.

- All apps are now running. Use the container app running at http://localhost:8082 to validate the functionality.
- Inside the insurance folder under src folder you’ll see a file named seeder.js. Open it and copy any of the email Id from the static user.
- Ender the copied email id on the login screen and click login.

## Please note, having node js and npm installed on your machine is a must to run React app.
